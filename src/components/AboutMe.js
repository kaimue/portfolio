          <p>
            I finished a boot-camp in web & app development in 2022 and come
            from a background of photography and movie-making. I focus on
            frontend development and my skills include HTML, CSS, SASS,
            JavaScript, and React and I am steadily deepening my knowledge in
            those. Apart from that I although have basic understanding of
            backend development. My former creative work gives me a good eye for
            layout and design, that I can now apply to my website-UI. I am
            always working on improving my skills and looking forward for new
            challenges.

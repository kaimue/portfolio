          <p>
            I finished a boot-camp in web & app development in 2022 and come
            from a background of photography and movie-making. I focus on
            frontend development and also have basic understanding of backend
            development. My former creative work gives me a good eye for layout
            and design, that I can now apply to my website-UI. I am always
            working on improving my skills and looking forward to new
            challenges.

import React from "react";

const AboutMe = () => {
  return (
    <div className="component">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Thus the best way this element can be used is in layouts. You can simply
        create multiple layouts, for e.g.- the Dashboard Layout(for the profile
        and members page) or the Main Layout(for login and logout, basically
        when the user is not signed in). Finally, you can simply inject
        whichever component one needs depending on its route rather than
        wrapping each route component in a parent layout component like:
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutMe;
